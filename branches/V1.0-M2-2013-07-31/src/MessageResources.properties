about.us.body.text=<p>The first Double Pizza restaurant opened in early 1991 on Queen Mary Road in Montreal\u2019s Snowdon neighbourhood, and this is where we started implementing our concept of giving our clientele the best quality food at the lowest price possible.</p><p>Many of our customers found it hard to believe that we could give them two full-value pizzas at such an unbelievably fantastic price. This inspired us to push the concept even further by redesigning our open-concept kitchen to be even more visible so that every customer could watch their pizza being prepared with fresh dough, lots of home-made sauce, fresh–not frozen–crispy vegetables and finally crowned with lots of first-quality cheese before being put into our oven.</p><p>With the opening of our second store later the same year, we were able to further fine-tune our \u0022Best Price - Best Quality\u0022 concept.</p><p>It was only two years later, in 1993, that we decided that we were ready to consider further expansion and accepted an offer to open a franchised location. Since that momentous decision, we have not looked back. Our growth has been steady and strong. We now number over thirty Double Pizza restaurants (and counting!) in the Greater Montreal area, including Laval and the North and South Shores.</p><p>Based on the principle that \u0022a chain is only as strong as its weakest link\u0022, every one of our franchisees receives our individual attention and support. Our District Managers have over twenty years’ experience in pizza delivery operations, and they are constantly visiting each location with the sole aim of supporting our franchisees and helping them iron out any problem, no matter how large or small, that might present an obstacle to the smooth running of their franchise.</p>
body.fun.zone=<p>Double Pizza is inviting you to participate for a chance to win free lunch for your company or team for up to 50 people!<br>Share your story and the reason why you should deserve to win and the best story will win!<p>
